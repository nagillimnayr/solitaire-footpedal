This solitaire game was created in Unity and reads input from a foot pedal to draw cards. It was created to study whether a custom video-game controller can be used in gait rehabilitation for patients suffering from drop foot. Drop foot is a condition that causes difficulty dorsiflexing the ankle (lifting the front of the foot) and is common after stroke.

The game selected for the rehabilitation is solitaire as it has no timing elements and can be grasped quickly. The playing card assets were open source. The game is designed to read input from the foot pedal to draw cards. A threshold value must be reached on the foot pedal to trigger the drawing function. Data on the number of repetitions, and average range of motion is recorded for analysis. Once the suggested number of repetitions have been reached, or an attempted repetition takes too long, the game will enable mouse/ touch controls to avoid exhaustion or frustration.
